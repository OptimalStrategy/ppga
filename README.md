# PPGA Script
PPGA Script is a scripting language that transpiles to Lua. It provides a more familiar C-style syntax and syntactic sugar, designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate when writing scripting commands in lua.

See [tour.ppga](tour.ppga) for a quick tour.

## Syntax Highlighting
There's a syntax highlighting plugin for vscode. It maybe installed from the [vscode-ppga](vscode-ppga) directory.
